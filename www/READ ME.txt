  events.json and specials.json : usage!

  Put your text in between the quotation marks, i.e. "text here",

  If your text already contains quotation marks (apostrophe's don't matter)
  you MUST put a backslash before each, i.e " Someone said \"quote\". ",
                                        OR  " Someone said 'quote'.",
                                        Either will work fine.

  You also need to ensure there is a comma after each field (end of each line)
  AND after each different set (after the } bracket) otherwise nothing will work!
  BUT commas should not be placed after the final fields in any set (i.e. after the "image" line,
  and the very last } bracket)

  Put as many sets/events/specials in as you wish, just follow these rules and make
  sure all of the sets are between the square ( [ ] ) brackets

  They will always appear in the same order on the app as in here.

  Here's a set template (good to copy/paste)
  
  {
    "title" : "",
    "text" : "",
    "moreText" : ""
  },
